Write a program to check leap year using if else.

* [Hint:Take an input of any number. Store it in some variable say year. If a year is exactly divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year. Or if a year is exactly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year.]

 Create a program to calculate the annual salary of an employee by using inheritance.

** Create a subclass named "Employee" that inherits from the "User" class.
* Add the following additional properties and methods: Properties: salary(double):representing the monthly salary of the employee Method: double calculateAnnualSalary():to calculate the annual salary earned by the employee.
* In the main method, create an object of "Employee" class.
** Calculate the annual salary of the employee and display it.. [Hint:Use constructor or setter methods to set the value]
